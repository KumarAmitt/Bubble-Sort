# Bubble-Sort

> This project was developed as a learning project part of the Microverse curriculum.

Part of the learning ruby curriculum, we were tasked to create two array sorting functions. The functions are the
implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. The **bubble_sort** function accepts an array of integers and sorts them
in an ascending order of magnitude. The second function, the **bubble_sort_by** requires that we make use of ruby's block
and yield feature to pass in a predicate to the sort function.
